To create points or bullet points in Markdown, you can use asterisks (*), plus signs (+), or hyphens (-) followed by a space. Here's how you can create a simple bullet list with points:

```markdown
- First point
- Second point
- Third point
```

You can also use asterisks or plus signs, and they will produce the same result:

```markdown
* Alternative point 1
* Alternative point 2

+ Another option 1
+ Another option 2
```

You can nest points by adding additional spaces before the asterisk, plus sign, or hyphen:

```markdown
- Main point
  - Subpoint 1
  - Subpoint 2
- Another main point
  - Subpoint A
  - Subpoint B
```

Additionally, you can create numbered lists by using numbers followed by a period and a space:

```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

Markdown will automatically format these as ordered (numbered) lists. Nested numbered lists work in the same way as nested bullet lists:

```markdown
1. Main item
   1. Subitem A
   2. Subitem B
2. Another main item
   1. Subitem X
   2. Subitem Y
```

You can create a variety of lists and structures in Markdown, making it a simple and easy-to-read way to format text. These lists are widely supported in Markdown parsers used in various platforms for documentation, including GitHub, Bitbucket, and many blogging platforms.
