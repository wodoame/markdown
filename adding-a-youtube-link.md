To add a YouTube video link to your Markdown and display the YouTube video thumbnail as an image, you can use the following syntax:

```markdown
[![Alt text](https://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID)
```

Replace `YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID` with the actual ID of the YouTube video you want to embed.

Here's a breakdown of the syntax:

- `[![Alt text]`: This is the image link syntax in Markdown.
- `(https://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID/0.jpg)`: This is the URL for the YouTube video thumbnail. The `/0.jpg` at the end fetches the default quality thumbnail.
- `](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID)`: This is the link to the actual YouTube video. Clicking on the image will redirect to the video.

Make sure to replace `YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID` with the actual ID of the YouTube video you want to embed.

For example:

```markdown
[![Sample Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/dQw4w9WgXcQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
```

This will display the thumbnail of the video with the title "Sample Video," and clicking on it will take you to the YouTube video.

# Constructing the image link (Just to be clear)
To get the image link for the YouTube video thumbnail, you can follow these steps:

1. Go to the YouTube video you want to embed.
2. Click on the "Share" button below the video.
3. Click on the "Copy" button to copy the video URL.

Now, construct the image link using the YouTube video ID. The YouTube video ID is typically found in the URL after the `v=` parameter. For example, in the URL `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`, the video ID is `dQw4w9WgXcQ`.

Construct the image link as follows:

```
https://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID/0.jpg
```

Replace `YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID` with the actual video ID you copied.

Here's an example using the video ID from the previous example:

```
https://img.youtube.com/vi/dQw4w9WgXcQ/0.jpg
```

This link will point to the default quality thumbnail for the specified YouTube video. You can use this link in the Markdown syntax provided in the previous response to embed the YouTube video thumbnail in your markdown document.
