In Markdown, you can include images using the following syntax:

```markdown
![Alt text](URL)
```

Here, "Alt text" is alternative text for the image, and "URL" is the URL or path to the image file. The alt text is used for accessibility, describing the content of the image.

Here are a few examples:

1. **Image from a URL:**

    ```markdown
    ![Alt text](https://example.com/image.jpg)
    ```

2. **Image from a local file:**

    ```markdown
    ![Alt text](path/to/local/image.jpg)
    ```

    Make sure the path is correct and relative to the location of your Markdown file.

3. **Image with Alt text:**

    ```markdown
    ![A cute cat](https://example.com/cat.jpg)
    ```

Replace the example URLs and paths with the actual ones you want to use. Additionally, you can add optional attributes, such as `width` or `height`, to control the size of the displayed image. For example:

```markdown
![A cute cat](https://example.com/cat.jpg){width=300px}
```

Keep in mind that Markdown itself doesn't provide extensive control over image styles or layout. If you need more advanced features, you may want to consider using HTML for greater customization.
